# Python Practice 🐍📂

This repository contains various projects that I've worked on to practice and enhance my Python programming skills. These projects cover a range of topics from API interactions to natural language processing and web scraping. All the projects are purely for learning purposes.

## Projects

### 🚀 APIs 
In this project, I explored how to interact with APIs using Python, specifically focusing on the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve stock data. The tasks included fetching stock market data using both the Alpha Vantage Python package and manual HTTP requests.

### 📜 text_analysis
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data. Activities include data cleaning, generating word clouds, analyzing word frequency, visualizing data, performing sentiment analysis using VADER, and identifying topics through topic modeling.

### 💻 website_scraping
This project utilizes web scraping techniques to retrieve data from websites. Tasks include parsing HTML content with BeautifulSoup, locating specific HTML tags, and extracting hyperlinks from web pages.

### 🔍 ctypes_2024-06
This is a small experimental project where I explored how to use the `ctypes` library to interact between C and Python code. It contains just 2 lines of code demonstrating this interaction.
